                New to the web development world, I really don't have much to put here yet, although
                that will change sooner rather than later. I'm a 32 year old guitarist, a Sagittarius,
                and I live in West Philadelphia with my cat Pepper. I grew up in the Philadelphia area,
                although spent most of my 20's living in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been a professional musician for the last 10 years. I have toured the country,
                engineered, written, produced and recorded singles, EPs, full length records, and have
                appeared as a session guitarist on dozens of projects recorded in various locations
                around the country. While I love playing music, the career and lifestyle simply don't
                feel sustainable, hence the switch to web design and programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                When not playing music, I enjoy building and creating things, solving puzzles, biking,
                reading, cooking and playing with Pepper. I hope to use web development and programming
                to make tools for people to access information and make better choices regarding sustainable
                living under 21st century late capitalism in the hopes that the machinery and infrastructure
                of the modern world can be used to create a better world for future generations.
