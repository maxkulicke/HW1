bootcamp HW1: portfolio

This portfolio website template is my first pass at creating the basic architecture and appearance of
a functional, well laid out website. 

I would do certain things differently in retrospect, but it works and fits the criteria as best as I
was able, so i'm happy with it and will submit as is.

A good learning experience
